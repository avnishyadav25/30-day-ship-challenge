| 2 | Build an AI Agent in 10 minutes | Build | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/first-ai-planning-agent-10-minutes-n8n-tutorial.html) <br> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413162844856418305/) <br> [X Post](https://x.com/avnish_yadav25/status/2007398320713691152) / [Thread](https://x.com/avnish_yadav25/status/2007397864096620549) <br> [Threads Post](https://www.threads.com/@avnish.codes/post/DTC5SHRkrH6) / [Thread](https://www.threads.com/@avnish.codes/post/DTC5Yw5kqOZ?xmt=AQF0BYzk9N4qVfQnqDIqtVw0tR_-SYyv-LPTQce5zSBUETI) | Agents 101: roles/tools/memory + failure modes |
| 3 | Prompt upgrades that 2× output quality | Automate | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/personal-prompt-system-double-ai-output-quality.html) | Prompt frameworks: role/context/constraints + eval basics |
| 4 | Why Early Devs Lose to Automation | Mindset | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/why-early-developers-lose-to-automation.html) <br> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/avnishyadav25_developers-automation-n8n-activity-7414157712055365632-UyHD) <br> [X Post](https://x.com/avnish_yadav25/status/2008392833741578500) <br> [Threads Post](https://www.threads.com/@avnish.codes/post/DTJ9Qiwkoa4) | Automation is leverage, not shortcuts. Early devs believe automation is "advanced" or "later-stage." That belief is wrong. |
| 5 | What n8n Really Is (Not Just a Tool) | Build | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/n8n-thinking-framework-for-developers.html) | n8n is a thinking framework. Most tutorials explain n8n as "Zapier alternative." That's misleading. |
| 6 | Your First Real Automation (No AI) | Build | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/stop-adding-ai-before-you-have-logic-build-reliable-n8n-workflows-first.html) <br> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/avnishyadav25_n8n-automation-aiworkflows-activity-7415001831686369280-Qch8) | Logic before intelligence. AI is useless without logic. |
| 7 | When AI Actually Adds Value | Build | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/ai-decision-engine-not-replacement.html) | AI = decision engine, not replacement. Classification, summarization, scoring, rewriting. |
| 8 | Prompting Is Not Chatting | Automate | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/stop-writing-prompts-that-fail-contract-based-approach.html) | Prompts are contracts. Prompts as specifications with inputs, constraints, and outputs. |
| 9 | Why Your AI Output Is Generic | Automate | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/ai-output-average-missing-constraints.html) | Missing constraints cause bad output. AI produces average output because developers give average instructions. |
| 10 | The Automation Mental Model | Mindset | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/automation-breaking-think-features-not-flows.html) | Think in flows, not features. Input → transform → decide → output. |
| 11 | Automating Learning Itself | Automate | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/stop-studying-manually-automate-learning-n8n-ai.html) | Learn faster with systems. Automate notes, summaries, and revision using n8n + AI. |
| 12 | Building Your First AI Agent (Properly) | Build | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/ai-agents-structured-workflows-not-magic.html) | Agents need structure. Agents as workflows with memory and rules — not magic bots. |
| 13 | Why Most AI Agents Fail | Build | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/ai-agent-guardrails-hallucinations-memory-validation.html) | Missing guardrails. Hallucinations, memory drift, and lack of validation. |
| 14 | Memory in Automation Systems | Build | [x] | [Blog Post](https://blog.avnishyadav.com/2026/01/short-term-vs-long-term-memory-ai-systems.html) | Memory must be controlled. Short-term vs long-term memory and when to use each. |
| 15 | Scoring AI Output | Automate | [ ] | | AI must be judged. Scoring outputs (clarity, usefulness, accuracy) and rejecting bad responses. |
| 16 | Multi-Step AI Pipelines | Build | [ ] | | One call is not enough. Chaining AI steps (generate → score → rewrite) produces professional output. |
| 17 | Parallel vs Sequential Automation | Build | [ ] | | Speed vs accuracy tradeoff. When to fan out calls and when to gate them. |
| 18 | Debugging Automations | Career | [ ] | | Systems fail quietly. Logging, checkpoints, and failure visibility in n8n. |
| 19 | Automation as Portfolio | Career | [ ] | | Proof beats certificates. Automation demos outperform resumes. |
| 20 | Thinking Like a Systems Engineer | Career | [ ] | | Systems > scripts. Logic, AI, memory, scoring, flows — the mindset shift. |
| 21 | Why Consistency Beats Talent | Mindset | [ ] | | Systems remove motivation. Automation removes reliance on discipline and motivation. |
| 22 | Turning Automations into Products | Career | [ ] | | Internal tools → assets. Personal automations become products or templates. |
| 23 | Content Automation for Devs | Automate | [ ] | | Teaching scales trust. Dev content can be automated without losing quality. |
| 24 | Avoiding Automation Overengineering | Build | [ ] | | Simple > complex. Restraint and minimalism in system design. |
| 25 | When NOT to Automate | Mindset | [ ] | | Judgment matters. Opportunity cost and maintenance burden. |
| 26 | How Seniors Actually Work | Career | [ ] | | Seniors think in leverage. Junior vs senior workflows using automation examples. |
| 27 | Building in Public (Correctly) | Career | [ ] | | Teach systems, not progress. Why posting "learning" fails and teaching systems works. |
| 28 | Your Automation Stack Blueprint | Build | [ ] | | A reusable architecture. Full stack as a reference model. |
| 29 | 30 Days of Systems: Lessons | Proof | [ ] | | What actually worked. Real learnings, not vanity metrics. |
| 30 | Your Next 90-Day Path | Career | [ ] | | Direction beats speed. Clear next roadmap using automation. |
